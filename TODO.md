High priority
===========

* add a _show file on github.com_ command, i.e.
  * `superfly/foo/bar` ->
    [https://github.com/chartbeat/chartbeat/blob/master/foo/bar](https://github.com/chartbeat/chartbeat/blob/master/foo/bar)

* automatically find 'project root' instead of hardcoded path in `globalff`

Other posibilities
==================

* Check out [jedi](https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi) for Python mode

* mode for file overview with function / class overview

* folding?

* highlight all of current line without screwing syntax highlighting

* timed undo (i.e. like vim `:earlier`, that can undo to a state X minutes ago)
